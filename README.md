### Background

Team Deep-State was tasked with using Machine Learning to solve a problem worth solving, analyzing, and visualizing.  The team decided to perform a sentiment analysis on Twitter tweets pertaining to the Impeachment of President Donald Trump.  To perform this analysis, we had to create code to live stream tweets on the selected topic, load the data into Postgres database, run the data through our sentiment testing, which identified the tweets as positive or negative, and visualize the live results on a line graph and plotting the locations of the tweets on a map.
